# The first truly decentralized blogging platform

A decentralized blogging platform that lives in the sia blockchain. It allows to create self-contained decentralized blogs. This means that the blogs allow to create new posts, and publish them within the blog, without the need of external tools.

Currently hosted in: https://siasky.net/hns/wakio/

An example of the blogs that our platform can create is available in: https://siasky.net/hns/bunnu/
